                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">I have a dual citizenship with Australia and South Africa. I have completed a Diploma in Screen and Media in my high school years. I have many interests; I enjoy playing poker and have an avid love of rap music. I love how Information Technology covers a wide range of topics like machine learning to predict financial markets, true Artificial Intelligence, and advancements in robotics. The thing that excites me most is that there are many fields in IT that are still being developed. Hence why my interest sparked in IT, I think that IT will be able to support me remotely when necessary.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>My results described me well but should be taken with a grain of salt. I relate to having trouble executing my ideas and I can be indecisive with important decision making.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>I prefer practical examples, trial and error and case studies. I also like learning about things that I can experience and learn effectively. I know that when I learn, I learn best by explaining concepts out loud or to others, teaching in a roundabout way.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>My results have shown me that I may have a difficulty when working with a team. My indecisiveness is what I feel lets me and possibly my team down. I leave projects till the last minute before sharing. When working in a group I will have to consider all my other team members; this will be a new challenge for me. I will benefit from a team which has a decisive leader. I love working alone but will have to give this up and give up control of projects when working as a team and not as an individual. I will overcome this eventually.<br>

I have the coolest MySpace known to man on the internet. With my two trades behind me that are tied closely to IT with automation and Tv/ Data installs, I finally feel it’s the right time in my life to start studying something I love. I am now in the right frame of mind to finish what I started many moons ago, something truly important to me.

                    <br> My main learning style is Pragmatist followed by Reflector, Theorist and Activist. Matching so well with Pragmatist I am concerned with matter of fact and not what could or should be. I also like to stand back and observe to a certain extent. I am slightly cautious, but I also like to collect and analyse information presented to me. I think of problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. I aim to fit things into a rational order. I do tend to immerse myself into new experiences, I enjoy the here and now. I tend to be open minded enthusiastic and flexible.I see myself and extremely introverted in which I find it hard to interact with others a little hard at times. None of my traits I believe will not weigh heavily when working in a group or team environment. I do tend to get a tad grumpy with people who do not pull their weight and contribute to a team. This, I need to consider, and I would consider this to be a downfall of mine and I must remember that I am not the only one working in a team, I must remember to share the load.<br>

I am an Electrician by trade, and I am looking toward a career change from construction sites and the building industry. I love to build PCs. When I was a younger, I remember thinking that it was impossible that somebody can create such a beautiful digital landscape in which I can play in. My interest in IT stemmed from there. I am a great problem solver, so my love of fixing computers or phones for friends and family grew out of satisfaction. I am a support IT Analyst, so whilst I do have experience in the IT world, I would like to consolidate my knowledge and learn a lot of new things.<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-9"> I am a Brisbane born mum of two teenage children. I currently work in the health sector and would like to continue my IT path from many years ago, somehow a good life got in the way. My interest in IT was sparked whilst at school, my teacher was my inspiration just as the world wide web become known to humans. Boy has technology come far; my imagination was filled with endless possibilities. I am not sure to what my exact interest in IT is, but I have worked with 3D graphics before and enjoyed this immensely. I do not have a background in IT apart from using my mobile phone daily but would like to pursue something different other than health care given this crazy covid world in which we live.<br>

                    <br> Whilst I am known in my test results as the caregiver, I tend to be extroverted rather than introverted, loyal and organised. Whilst I enjoy working independently, I enjoy working with others and gain energy out of doing so. I enjoy helping others and am sensitive to their needs. I do like to have control over my environment and like to feel in command.<br>

                    <br>I remember things best once I have gained experience in them and do best by being out of my chair and giving things ago in a practical sense. I don’t understand things if just read them. Reading bores me. I talk a lot with my hands and have been known to be a fidgety student because usually sitting too long drives me nuts.<br>

                    <br> At times I can be creative, curious, and adventurous and then other times I feel I need routine. I am generally a good problem solver in which I consider the tried-and-true method, but I also like to think outside the box. I tend to be a social butterfly and love meeting new people and building relationships with others. I tend to speak more than I listen but always seem calm and level-headed. My mood can fluctuate depending on the day, sorry group. I tend to look on the brighter side of life and even though my mood can fluctuate I try and give out a vibrant personality. I do my best at everything I do even if there is nothing in it for me.I listen to people when and where needed and help in the best way I know how can usually offer helpful suggestions in solving a problem. I am a visual learner not so textbook based. I generally follow direction well given a task; I am not a group leader. I must learn to give myself more credit where credit is due. I have a bad habit of not liking to work in groups and prefer to work alone, this is something that I will learn to overcome as I get happiness from helping other people. I am not a good leader I am a follower.<br>

I am plumber by trade and have worked on many prestigious buildings of Sydney. I am an avid fan or snooker and anything that is played on a pool table. My love for this game began when I was 18 and was legally allowed to go to the pub. I was fascinated about the game and how the players achieved each shot.The movie Terminator 2 was released back in 1991, and although I viewed it a few years after this, it was this that sparked my interest in IT. I thought it was incredible that there could be robots that destroy mankind. So, in today’s world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a reality. I undertook a degree in finance which has helped to further my interest in IT with the programming algorithmic trading bots, stock screeners, economic indicators, and news scanners. The world of investment has quickly become robot versus robot.<br>

                    <br> I am introverted and prefer to think before saying. I am less likely to assert my opinion even when I hold strong opinions and values about certain subjects and topics. I take responsibility for my work and my actions. I would rather sit back and observe a task to be done and complete it by doing and then learning. I prefer to analyse my surroundings. I don’t like laziness and dishonesty. Honesty is far more important than emotional state and I am sometimes considered blunt or cold. I am a thinker and enjoy problem solving.<br>

With our collective job descriptions, we have the broad skill set and creative depth for a top performing IT company that can meet the requirements of our potential clients. In our team we have someone to enhance graphics, to design systems and application, a team to collaborate data and develop programs, skilled computer programmers both front and back ends, and someone to test and implement the application or software. We have 4 future engineers, 1 developer and 1 artist. All the job descriptions are similar but distinct and they collaborate to assist in the creation of a final product. It is interesting to note that within our contingent we have a 33% female makeup that is well above the median percentage of individuals entering the IT industry workforce. This would suggest a significant growth of the IT workforce as a whole and a shift for increased interest and diversity in the workspace.</p>
