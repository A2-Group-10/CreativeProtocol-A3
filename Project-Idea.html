          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">With an ever-increasing popularity and demand for independent craft style breweries in Australia, Creative Protocol proposes to develop an application for mobile devices that will allow easy and efficient map and information access to explore local listed breweries. The App would be designed to work on iOS and Android devices and would also include website application capabilities. The Application would rely on GPS technology to gather and pin information, allow radius searching of local breweries and venues and to search for specific breweries. A review rating system, push notifications, digital calendar for logging and tracking events and simple feedback system will be incorporated to increase user interface engagement. We will be filling a market gap for those who are time poor and want efficient triangulated access to their local beer creators.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">With significant demand for a product such as Frothy-Chop and a lack of market presence of Applications that are not limited to web-based design we are assured of the success and viability of our product.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The App is designed with an easy-to-use UI implementing the drop-down menus, free scrolling to different areas and GPS location triangulation. Upon finding an area, users can click on the icon and see the name and rating of a location and tap again to open to see menus, reviews, and events. There is also an easy to access taskbar, found on the top left, this provides more menu items such as a wish list for brews you would like to try or buy, events tab for any events that may be currently happening. This menu will also include a Feedback and Help section) so should any part of the application not be satisfactory; they can let us know and we can implement changes accordingly.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We believe the structure behind this app will be easily transferred into similar projects like a version for coffee shops, wineries, and gin distilleries.<img src="images/beerstats.png" width="450" style="width: 450px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic">&nbsp;A lack of availability and an increased demand demonstrate viability of the proposed application of Creative Protocol.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There have been significant increases in the number of Independent Breweries within Australia (99 in New South Wales out of 294 nationally) (Statista Nov. 2020), resulting in a lack of consolidated brewery information, reviews, and pinned locations available for easy reference by craft beer connoisseurs. Also, there has been a significant market shift in recent years with increasing number of micro-pub style breweries being created due to lack of shelf space in major retailers, (Sutton, 2021). Creative Protocol propose to create a mobile phone application and website that will help customers discover new breweries and their products, and plan for any trips to the cellar door using our brewery catalogue. Current market analysis indicates that there is a gap in the market for a tool with the level of functionality included, with an existing website (with no associated mobile app) identified without key proposed features included.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There are other apps and websites available that offer similar user information; however, we are aiming to provide our users a point of difference. These competitor applications are lacking the depth of scope we are trying to provide our users, lacking several important and sought-after features, and easy to navigate user experience. Some points of difference include:&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">

            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">One of our biggest competitors, Crafty Pint, was initially crated as an online magazine. They have managed to acquire breweries to sign up through the popularity of their website as a review base for breweries and have now created a limited web-based platform for viewing locally reviewed breweries. We intend to use a combination of methods to populate the app with brewery information, accessing backing from IBA and populating from their established database, using data that is publicly available and then reaching out to the individual breweries and request more specific information like what drinks they have on tap, upcoming events, and upcoming specialty releases.<br>
              <br>Our user submitted reviews of the beers available at each brewery and the ability to build individual profiles of users based off ratings to recommend breweries and specific brews that users with a similar profile also rated highly is a point of difference in our application that is unseen in our competitors. Our competitors also do not offer any option to search for specific brews, only to search breweries and then view the catalogue. We believe this is a fundamental flaw in our competitors apps due to the belief that users not only want to visit different breweries but may also want to search for a particular brew and find out where it is available.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Unlike our competitors our date will be sourced primarily from IBA and will therefore be the most comprehensive list of breweries while also allowing listed brewers to add details and updates to their listings. We will provide incentive for breweries to deliver information to us when it is relevant by publishing content that attracts users to the app. The content will include at home craft brewing tips, articles written about newly released brews and upcoming breweries (items that are consistently missing and asked for on our competitors’ products). If user’s sign-up to gain access to brewery and brew related content, breweries themselves will have a reason to provide us with the data we require.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As we have established the existence of web-based and low scope alternatives to the product we are planning to create it is evident that we can carry the proposed app to fruition. To engage full functionality of our App we will need to invest time developing key skill factors and involving skilled contractors. There is a significant demand for the product we are offering and the ability to create it is evident. This product is both desirable and feasible in its development and design.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We will implement a map style feature that is going to use GPS technology to gather the information on your location and pin surrounding venues to give the user a clean and easy way to see where they are in relation to venues, or swipe around freely to explore any area. A search bar is to be included also if you would like to search for a specific brewery or a favourite beer&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We propose to include a user rating system to allow clear access to specialty beers and breweries other users enjoyed. Recommendations can be given when the ratings you have added personally can be compared to other users who have enjoyed similar. A 0–5-star rating attached to each product and venue is how we will achieve this. There will also be a section where the user can write a comment further explaining why they have chosen to give the rating they did. In future updates we plan to implement an events page, a digital calendar where any upcoming events/special brews can be added, and users alerted.&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Push notifications are another feature to be included. This will alert users when a specific brew creator has released or made an awaited product available. When a user has visited a brewery and given a high rating, they will be notified of any events that are happening at that brewery from the information stored in the events calendar. The same applies if they liked a particular beer, they could see what brewers offer the same or similar products.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The user interface (UI) is another Creative Protocol feels is of importance to the rollout of our application. The UI needs to be attractive and easy to navigate for users with varying technological knowledge. To achieve this we will use clean, bright, and bold colours, utilizing large buttons to help guide the user through menus and make it clear which buttons to select. A quick guide showing new users through the features of the app is also to be implemented. With the number of different smartphones on the market currently, the app also needs to be adaptable to different screen sizes, plus have a working website version.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We want to understand our users’ experiences within the app to allow us to tackle obstacles as they occur. We will achieve this with a simple feedback system which will be a text box in which you can report a bug, give ideas on new features, and give general feedback both positive and/or negative. Testing will also be conducted prior to release on a controlled test group to ensure the application is functional before roll-out.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Creative Protocols goal is to meet up every week on a Thursday at 6.30pm (Melbourne time) and discuss how our project is progressing and any issues that have arisen throughout the week. With the use of a Team Captain, we have been able to maintain the flow of the meetings and the project and as a result the Team Captain types up the minutes of the meeting that have been held. This is so all the group members are aware of what is happening with the project and the project is moving forward.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We have managed as a group to meet up via MS Teams weekly and discuss in detail about our project and any hurdles that the group is having at the time. As a group, with the help of Team Captain, we delegate sections to be completed to group members and we effectively use MS Teams, and we have setup Kanban with a Tasks tab for the group to complete when sections have been completed by specific group members. This helps keep the project with a realistic completion timeframe. Our Editor can then create our report to go with our product.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This project started off as a simple idea to make information on breweries more accessible, with no other immediately recognisable applications that do this, enter “Frothy Chop”. Creative Protocol felt this to be a worthy venture to pursue. As the idea came to fruition at the most basic of levels, we wanted users to be able to create an account and build an app that could utilize a GPS enabled map to easily identify to users the areas in which breweries were close by, most breweries are hard to find and it’s seemingly hard to know whether that brewery is known for a positive customer experience. Once you have found one on the map, you can then click on it to view customer reviews and an overall rating. Many things have changed over the course of this semester, as our knowledge has increased, we have had new ideas, looked at the possibility of new features and thought about how to implement these in further detail as we will try to portray here. Due to the scope of this semester unfortunately we are greatly restricted by time, many of the things we wish to achieve will have to be planned in detail without the chance to take further action.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-custom-color-2">Development &amp; Backend</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Firstly, like nearly every mobile app, Frothy Chop needs a backend service. With any of the 3 major players (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google) services you can rapidly build backend services that can scale to meet demand, synchronize data across devices and send notifications. As discussed briefly in assignment two, we believe AWS Amplify is an attractive idea as this is going to help us in creating a backend and other components without needing the extensive expertise to create one from scratch. This will help to centralise all the app components within a manageable console, the Amplify components will make it easier to set up the building blocks of our app without the need for outsourcing as many specific skills that would be costly, also we will only be paying for what services we use, this will prevent us from spending investment money on hardware that isn’t going to be utilized. We plan to use a hosted cloud database to store account information, reviews and feedback of our users, extremely popular amongst the biggest tech companies in the world, an open-source software known as PostgreSQL is a standout, it allows huge customization for developers, has extensive capacity and is highly trusted for its data integrity. Keeping in uniform with the previously mentioned feature, the AWS Amazon Relational Databases will make it easy to set up, operate and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud. Amazon RDS will manage time consuming tasks such as the PostgreSQL software upgrades, storage management and data backups for disaster recovery, whilst still allowing access to all the capabilities of the PostgreSQL database engine that is so familiar with professionals that we may have to outsource to. The core functionality of the app relies on data sourced from the IBA, to provide information on breweries, their products and any events or specials that they may be running. This data will be queried and synchronised with Frothy Chop’s backend database using IBA’s Application Programming Interface (API). Data queries that by their nature require more immediate and live responses than the window of database synchronisation allows will be performed against IBA’s API directly, with queries coming from the app traversing an API gateway or Enterprise Integration Platform (EIP) hosted as part of Frothy Chop’s backend.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The use of APIs to exchange data between the IBA and Frothy Chop provides a clear demarcation between IBA’s and Frothy Chop’s internal infrastructure. Queries against the API limit the type of transactions allowed between external entities to those that are intended for 3rd party access and provide a layer of security between both entities systems, while the use of an Enterprise Integration Platform enables the app to be able to communicate via the EIP to multiple different entities without needing to know the specifics about that entity’s API.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The decision to transfer the data from IBA into Frothy Chop’s backend and keep it synchronised and the use of a hosted API gateway or EIP instead of the app querying IBA’s API directly will allow further breweries not associated with the IBA or other industries to be integrated into the app with minimal effort, and to ensure that the app can continue to function should IBA suffer an outage with their infrastructure.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-custom-color-2">Features</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Figma has emerged as a candidate in terms of creating our User Interface, this will allow us to create a great looking app whilst we all have limited time and limited experience in coding. This is one of the few things we’ve been able to action within the time constraints, the artefacts we have from this stay true to the original vision, a clean simple and easy on the eye app that utilizes the Creative Protocol colour scheme and looks inviting to users. Once we have created something that is close to what we intend to build we will outsource the coding to professional programmers to then create the code.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">One of the main features (also planned to act as a home page) is the interactive map. Of course, the most well-known GPS software is Google maps, they have extensively mapped just about every single road on the globe. We believe that it could be desirable to use the Google Maps platform, for this we will need a Google maps API to be integrated into our app, this way we can easily scale up and down and be charged according to how many people are using our app. That being said, an important point to raise with this idea is how difficult it’s going to be to integrate multiple cloud platforms as we had planned previously to develop this app using AWS services, this is something we haven’t yet fully explored and needs to be extensively researched. Is the Amazon location service going to achieve this goal to the same standard? We haven’t had the time to explore this question yet due to time restrictions, any issues with synchronization would be detrimental to the project and the smooth user experience that we require</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">

            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Feedback is an essential part of our proposed first version release, it’s imperative to know the feelings of our users directly so we can make changes and implement updates accordingly. We shall utilize feedback widgets embedded within our app, the chance for feedback will be displayed once a user has completed a series of actions in the app and/or when they arrive on certain screens. It’s also important that if they chose to ignore prompts, we have opportunity to gain feedback whenever it's convenient to the user, we can achieve this by having open-ended widgets that are easily discoverable and should consider placing them in page headers or footers. We believe these to have a higher success rate than say an email survey system as most users tend to ignore these.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Push notifications will need to be triggered locally or sent from a third party service when the apps not running, as application publishers this Is a fantastic way to interact with our users. We must ensure that the app build can run and prompt users for notification authorization. They will allow us to maintain user engagement without asking for personal information and must be made up of the following elements; An app icon to clearly display that Frothy Chop is sending the user a notification, A short and snappy title to attract the attention of our users, A Short but concise description of the said notification and a timestamp. These push notifications should be able to both provide personalized messages for specific app users and general-purpose information targeted at a larger user base. App publishers can feasibly build their own infrastructure to address both above, however we believe it costly and unnecessary when we will have already outsourced to developers with AWS expertise and certification. We can utilize ‘Pinpoint’ within AWS services to deploy our notification backend (Intellipat 2021. What is AWS pinpoint?)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The above features mentioned are what we at Creative Protocol believe to be a minimum regarding a functioning app that aligns with the original vision. There are other features that have been pitched as ideas but are simply out of the scope of this assignment. Most notably is a proposed “events” section. This was planned to be a section where users can see which breweries have any special one-off brews or food options on the premises. Due to the sheer number of breweries in Sydney we don’t believe this to be a feasible feature to implement in an early version of our app, the sheer level of collaboration needed isn’t realistic considering we haven’t established any sort of relationships with any breweries yet, something to think about for future versions but out of reach as of this moment in time.&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Building a user-based app which involves the extraction of various data sources including public and private information, requires the team to assess all avenues of ethics, legality, and privacy. In modern times there are more and more legal cases raised regarding privacy breaches and unethical practices within the technology industry.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The rise of data privacy has even led to legal action being raised by government authorities against big tech such as the case of ACCC VS Google (Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission VS Google LLC 2021). Many customers were misled in believing that by clicking “Don’t save my location history” that their data would not be saved to Googles storage. This was misleading as the courts found users would need to further change additional settings to not have their location data saved by Google.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;As awareness spreads so does the annoyance, outrage, and alarm among ordinary, unsophisticated users of digital and information technologies as they learn of practices such as web tracking, behavioural advertising, surveillance of mobile communication, and information capture by mobile apps (Nissenbaum 2015)&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Creative Protocol will take the necessary steps in understanding the ethical and legal responsibilities involved to protect user privacy. We aim to achieve a thorough understanding of the following:&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Australian Government 2022) – To understand Australian legislation for the protection, handling, and storage of personal information of our users&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Australian Government 2022) – To enhance our ability to promote ethical practices and fairness towards our users and consumers.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Australian Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (Australian Securities Exchange Commission 2022)– To gain knowledge on how to operate within the governing bodies compliance and regulation legislation.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">

            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We have ideas for expansion outside of “Frothy Chop”, with the possibility to create similar apps for things such as wine and gin distilleries being of huge interest. For this idea to become a reality we need to retain the rights to our code. In Australia, Computer programming code can be registered as ‘literary works’ (Australian Copyright Act 1968) any addition or modification showing sufficient originality is also protected and is automatic from the moment the program represents a tangible form, however, to qualify we must demonstrate that we have used our skills and labour to create the software. It will also cover our user interface in the form of original text images and layout, meaning we will be able to create new apps whilst maintaining that familiar user experience. As owners of the Copyright in software we have exclusive rights to; make copies of the software, publish the software, communicate it to the public, make adaptations and license others to do any of the before mentioned. We will express this in the terms of the license agreement with the user.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-custom-color-2">Security</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Cyber security is of utmost importance to us and our team. On top of any obligations that may be applicable under the Privacy Act 1988 in Australia, serious damage to Creative Protocol’s reputation can occur if a data breach impacting users’ Personally Identifiable Information (PII) happens, or if Creative Protocol’s response to any such breach is not considered appropriate by the users. All reasonable measures will be taken to ensure the security of the environment and data held within the system.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Communication between the Frothy Chop app and the backend hosted in AWS will be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS), which provides assurance to the client app that the server it’s connecting to is who it says it is, as well as encrypting the traffic between the app and the server to ensure information cannot be seen by unauthorised parties or manipulated. The use of public Wi-Fi by end users, such as is present in a lot of hospitality venues, introduces risks to data security and integrity of communications from interception and rogue access points. Creative Protocol will make use of certificate pinning within the app, a practice that ensures the server’s certificate is the one expected, to ensure that interception, or man-in-the-middle, attacks are prevented.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The app’s supporting infrastructure hosted within AWS by necessity will be Internet-facing and susceptible to data breach attempts. The use of cloud native constructs for the traditional security roles of Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), such as Amazon API Gateway, AWS Network Firewall, AWS WAF and Amazon GuardDuty, will provide a layer of security in front of the front-end supporting servers while being able to scale with traffic load resulting from the increasing number of users.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, can provide significant benefits to businesses in assessing their Information Technology environments and the computer software they run (Goel &amp; Mehtre, 2015). Although it is practically impossible to have 100% vulnerability free systems, penetration testing can identify known issues with environment configuration and running software, providing businesses an opportunity to remove as many vulnerabilities as possible prior to a system going live and becoming Internet accessible (Goel &amp; Mehtre, 2015). Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing has a total 9 step process, being Scope, Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Detection, Information Analysis and Planning, Penetration Testing, Privilege Escalation, Result Analysis, Reporting and Clean Up. There are several forms of testing which can include manual testing, automated testing and fuzz testing. Penetration testing tools that Creative Protocol could possibly use are Metasploit, Nessus or Burp Suite, although it is recommended to engage a third-party specialist to perform the testing to provide a “fresh eyes” audit of the environment.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Whilst Cyber Security within Information Technology can be an overwhelming topic, Creative Protocol aims to use tools that are user friendly and low impact, but also functional and effective at protecting our data and computer systems. Creative Protocol is committed to ensuring that our data and that of our end users remains safe and away from unauthorised eyes.&nbsp;</span>

We have formed a cohesive and understanding group that has worked well together in identifying tasks that need to be completed and allocating the necessary timeframe for successful completion.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As all projects need a leader to oversee tasks and keep projects within scope and on time our team has created a dynamic and shifting leadership based on the skills required to produce the required task outcome. The fluidity of our team model has allowed our team to take the lead on different tasks based on aptitude and skill allowing other team members to develop their skill set while working towards the common goal.&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive mobile app that will present to its users the locations of any breweries in the area and to recommend to them brews liked by themselves or liked by others. The user will be able to see icons on a map that will present a page dedicated to that brewery. Individual brewery pages will include information on what is available and other users’ feedback. Every beer will have the opportunity to be rated on a scale between 1 and 5 stars and our users will be able to add a comment related to that beer. Also, users will be given the opportunity to ‘black book’ beers by adding them to their favourites page. Users will be able to view another profiles favourites page if interests and reviews align with another user therefore opening up recommended ‘favourites’ that may be outside their original location area of interest.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Creative Protocol has set a goal to create an application where all users can share information on certain brews allowing a more enjoyable and convenient craft beer experience and increasing foot traffic to new or undiscovered craft breweries in their area.&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A storyboard will allow us to create a prototype without having to code the initial prototype phase of our application development. The goal will be to show every screen in our app without going into detail creating code.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>

            <span class="u-text-custom-color-2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">•</span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;Wireframing- this will allow us to provide a more detailed version of the storyboard but still must remain clear and easy to understand for both developers and non-developers.<br>&nbsp;
            </span>
            <span class="u-text-custom-color-2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">•</span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;Figma-We are to use an open-source software such as Figma to deliver prototype Images of our desired UI elements. We are not to include Figma or its features itself as a deliverable, only the results of the completed template. This will allow us to illustrate the various functions of the app in a higher fidelity compared to both the storyboard and wireframing.<br>&nbsp;
            </span>
            <span class="u-text-custom-color-2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">•</span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;One we have the app screens finalized our designers will finalize the UI part of our app. The central function of our app is an updated Open streets map showing just our custom icons, we need not to be concerned with the technology or other points of interest, just the most basic road names, numbers, and relevant information. <br>
            </span>
            <span class="u-text-custom-color-2" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">•</span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;Completed source code, this is part of the development stage. Our development team will code the elements outlined in the previous design phases. Whilst daily change logs aren’t a deliverable, the developers will need full access to daily logs, and we can then<br>&nbsp;

            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">One of the most important deliverables, all elements of the app need to be tested exhaustively. This is imperative not only from technical perspective but also in the protection of data for our users. A dedicated quality assurance person will be assigned to the project to test all interactions within the app and ensure performance, reliability, and usability. It will need to be compared to previous wireframes and prototypes that were approved.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
              <span class="u-text-custom-color-2">Realistic Priorities</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As a new company, Creative Protocol has recognised there are significant time factors that will affect our ability to complete the initial phase of Frothy-Chop development. As with any app there are time constraints and although the team at Creative Protocol are ambitious, we acknowledge the fact that we have limited time to deliver this project in full.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The three main features of this app that must take priority and are achievable are the interactive map, the rating system, and the feedback section. It is our primary focus to ensure that these features are complete and functional upon the first prototype release. These features are the core to what makes our mobile application work on a functional level. Feedback is going to be priceless as this can act as a further stream of testing while we continue to grow and develop the application.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Other features that are beyond the restricted time frame we have for this initial prototype phase include push notifications, data pages and event calendar. We believe these features can be rolled out in future updates. Creative Protocol has a clear idea of the User Interface look and feel but we are anticipating that this will also be updated over time as we receive increased data through user feedback once the app is live. These future updates will add desirable functionality to the application and cement the point of difference the application brings to the market.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The application will use AWS Amplify Console to provide a cloud-hosted backend for database services hosting the data submitted by users and breweries, to process any event-based triggers such as push notifications, and to collate statistical data for presentation to other users and back to breweries.&nbsp;</span>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Creative Protocol take testing environments seriously and we aim to have a fully working application upon its release to the public. There are multiple ways of testing an application and we must consider multiple differences between devices such as screen size, operating systems and mobile network operators. It is important for the testing to be an on-going task as it will help us to have a better understanding of how the app is performing as we move through different stages of development. Testing mobile applications is more challenging than testing web apps on a desktop and creative protocol aim to mitigate these issues with mobile testing such as network variability (WIFI/3G/4G), phone performance with simultaneous application usage, battery consumption issues and memory leakage none of which are issues with testing desktop applications. Our initial testing phase will mitigate these issues using standardised hardware and testing environments before a testing rollout to broader environments is carried out.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Usability testing is to be done by real-life users rather than the development team as they may miss defects that are exclusively related to the user experience. Feedback on our application is a significant tool we plan to use in the development phase of our application. We believe it is imperative to get real, honest feedback as early in the development cycle as possible. We have planned the first step towards this as explorative usability testing with a working app prototype at its most fundamental level.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We believe that the earlier this initial testing phase is commenced the more efficient our application development will be as we will have the ability to create targeted development plans and timeframe them accordingly. This early testing phase we will also be of importance as we tailor and develop the overall design of the product. We believe the most cost-effective way to produce this feedback is to give selected people without prior knowledge (whilst still in the target audience) access to our app. Known as hallmark testing, this way we can obtain more honest feedback for improvement if needed. We will only need 5 test users to highlight 75%-99% of usability issues. To find these users within our target market will be a relatively simple exercise as we will find our test users in the location, we would expect our app to be used, Breweries.&nbsp;</span>

              <span class="u-text-custom-color-2">Security Testing</span>
              <br>We believe that security testing to ensure our app is protecting our user’s data is necessary even in initial phases of development.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Towards the end of the development cycle, Creative Protocol believe that an expert review is desirable. Although this will be and expensive budget cost this will provide peer feedback through testing the usability of the test application, providing feedback, and submitting results. The results of expert peer review testing will be an indicating factor when we will be ready to launch to the public.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We will also test the application ourselves on platforms such as Browserstack on an ongoing basis to ensure functionality and development. We believe it is important to test our mobile app on a real device cloud that offers an extensive range of Android and iOS mobile devices allowing simulation of how it is/will be working in real-world conditions.&nbsp;</span>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Creative Protocol has estimated with the best of their knowledge a projected timeframe for the extended period of 10 more allocated weeks of project development. The team at Creative Protocol plan to implement a strategy centred around design thinking (DT) in which we will utilise for the further 10 weeks of allocated project time. DT has been recognised as a methodology that promotes the design of engaging and user-friendly apps (Shahrasbi, Jin and Zheng 2021). With a further 10 weeks of project development, we believe that by implementing such a strategy, the team would present the best opportunity for the project’s success. According to the UK Design Council (UK Design Council 2010), DT is a method which understands problems and offers innovative solutions.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">DT has 5 main phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> – The first phase for the team is the empathize phase. This phase will allow the team to commence consumer surveying across multiple brewery locations to gain an insight into our users needs, behaviours, attitudes and experiences within a brewery setting. We feel that surveying can be approached in multiple forms such as, face to face interviewing which involves groundwork between brewery locations, we also believe that surveying can be completed through a more quantitative approach by gathering user data through traditional pen and paper surveying. The latter approach may be executed through solid communication and building relationships with local breweries as to gain permission to have our survey papers displayed within their brewery for patrons to fill out.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> – In the prototype phase the team will begin to build out a low fidelity prototype. Creative Protocol will design the app on paper through hand sketches and Microsoft PowerPoint. This lowfidelity prototype will be used amongst the group to test the useability and to gain feedback on its performance within the team before testing is taken further. After developing a low-fidelity prototype, the team will commence the building of a high-fidelity prototype. The team plan to use such applications as Figma (Figma 2022).&nbsp;</span>

            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> – Now the team has developed a low-fidelity prototype, and a high-fidelity prototype, the team can then take these developments into the testing phase. The testing phase involves numerous user testing within the team group, our targeted users, and any other outside parties which could provide professional and technical feedback such as fellow students, university tutors and lecturers and industry professionals.</span>

            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Understanding that all projects contain risks both known, and unknown is paramount to a successful outcome. By implementing risk management strategies as a team, we believe we can deliver the project in all aspects of success. To do this, we must identify the potential risks involved in building the application.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Our app will provide the end user with a range of features, from guiding them to a local brewery, rating their experience, receiving product updates and push notifications. As we implement features, we run the risks of trying to provide too much for the end user. A common practice in app development is to create an app which contains to many features and not enough purpose for the end user (Chanchal 2019). Building an app is all about the end users experience, so we must be sure to identify our end users’ needs correctly.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Another area of potential downfall for the project is in our own expectations of the app’s success. How sure are we that our app will be successful? We have identified other companies who provide the app with similarities, and we strive to create something better than currently offered. In attempting to recreate the industry benchmark, we may fail in our attempts to deliver a better application which may not necessarily be in demand from market participants. If we stretch the boundaries too far in the development of a new and improved brewery app, we may underestimate our markets requirements and venture into scope creep.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">App development requires many programming skills and resources to produce a well-functioning user-friendly application. As we undertake the development of the app, it is necessary for us as a group to identify the required skillset needed to achieve a successful development. Effective communication throughout the project’s life cycle is of high importance to assist the team in understanding the depth of software development skills required to complete our project. We must understand that our skillset may not be at the level required to fulfil the projects development requirements within the designated timeframe.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">For the application to be successful we will need to possess or outsource various skills. Cloud infrastructure is going to be an important part of our development, it is a necessity that within our team there is a good understanding of this technology (in this case AWS cloud services). Popular modern coding languages are also going to be required, Java, JavaScript and Swift (for Apple iOS) are notably the three necessary candidates for a cross platform mobile app. This expertise is readily available in the workforce, and we believe it to be feasible to obtain these skills as we do not currently have them within our team. We will be employing the use of DynamoDB, an automatic scaling database should the app be successful. This is an area of our development process we will need managed by a skilled professional.&nbsp;</span>
